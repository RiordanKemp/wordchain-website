          <h2>Krav Maga</h2>
          <p>I've been attending sidekicks martial arts for 6 years now.  I started when I was 14, and found the experience challenging but very rewarding.  My dad and I both attended 2-3 times a week when we lived nearby, but we've since moved an hour's drive away.
            Despite that, we still go 1-2 times a week whenever possible, since the quality of instruction hasn't been matched by any local studios.  That's in large part due to grandmaster Brian's 40 years of experience, many of which were spent fighting professionally.  
            The typical class tries to get you exhausted through basic physical exercises, like running and pushups, before practicing a couple techniques with a training partner.  After 30 minutes of practicing various techniques back-and-forth, two or three groups will join
            together for a "stress drill", where each person takes turns implementing the various techniques while everyone else in the group tries to surround them.  It's a mentally exhausting activity, since you're trying to avoid being cornered by 4-6 other people and apply
            various techniques, like escaping from a choke or getting away from somebody on the ground.  Despite that, the atmosphere is one of camaraderie, and everyone wants everybody else to succeed.
