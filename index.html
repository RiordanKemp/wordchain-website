          <h2>Game Details</h2>
          <p>Hive Mind is a post-apocalyptic 1v1 strategy card game, where two players compete against each other as lone survivors of a zombie apocalypse.  They've found limited resources in an only-partially zombified bee farm.  Each round, a new hive is played with a unique board layout, and players strive to grab
            as much honey as they can without taking the last card.  The player who removes the last card is the loser of the round, and loses additional points based on how much honey they have.  The winner gains points based on how much honey they have.  Honey cards have unique effects and some are infected, which can zombify players
            during subsequent rounds and make them contagious.  At the end of all 4 rounds, the player with the most points is the winner.  The game plays like a more chaotic, randomized version of Chess or Stratego, but playtesting seemed to demonstrate that strategy triumphs over luck (I played with several
            friends who are good at chess, while I am not.  I lost every single game, most of them quite badly).  I'm still clarifying game rules via consistent documentation and word usage, and I'm also implementing some systems to make early round configurations simpler to play (to ease players into the game) by making the amount of special honey cards only semi-random.  Hive Mind
            still needs a lot of work, but I find the development process fulfilling, and the game seems to have struck a chord with the target audience (chessheads).
