          <h2>My Experience</h2>
          <p>I've been playing LOL for MSU's teams for a few months, as a substitute player for the main team and a player for the JV team.  It's been a very demanding but cool experience,
            and I've met a lot of really nice people.  I've played LoL since I was 12 and I really love the game, so being able to play with a consistent team of people who also love the
            competition has been a lot of fun for me.  I'm currently working on improving my own play, since I'd like to play for the main team during 2025/2026, my Senior year, but I'm not
            good enough yet.  I hope that I'll be able to achieve a high level of play, regardless of which team I end up playing for, and it's been an awesome privilege to play tournaments
            and work on improving with other likeminded people.
